Canine
======

Canine is a Forge coremod primarily used with [Cauldron](https://github.com/MinecraftPortCentral/Cauldron) 
to patch objects from Forge mods that do not respect the regions/claims of Bukkit plugins such as 
[WorldGuard](https://github.com/sk89q/WorldGuard). Another one of its uses is to limit what types of blocks 
a certain object can break.
